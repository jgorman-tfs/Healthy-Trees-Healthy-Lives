This repository contains information related to the Healthy Trees, Healthy Lives Analysis. The final dashboard can be found at https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/449497482025452ca1c18f395afbcfe5/
## Overview
Research tells us nature, seeing it, being in and around it, is positively correlated with mental and physical health and trees are the framework for places of nature. <br>
Three simple ways community forestry can influence public health: <br>
·         Tree-lined streets <br>
·         Treescapes outside school and medical or residential care facility windows  <br>
·         Greenspace proximity to residences <br>
Higher density of street trees is associated with lower prevalence of obesity in residents and overall reduction in stress for pedestrians and commuters. <br>
Views of trees outside windows improve a variety of health metrics.  What better place to influence human health and well-being than our schools and medical facilities. Treescapes in parking lots and on approach to these facilities can reduce associated stress. <br>
People living more than ½ mile away from the nearest green space report poorer health-related quality of life compared those living closer.<br>

The Healthy Trees, Healthy Lives dashboard was created to equip minicipalities with information about their Urban Tree Canopy as it relates to their streets, schools and medical facilities. Additionally, residential areas are shown in relation to their distance to a park or greenspace.
